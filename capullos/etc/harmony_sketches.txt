Uses of sieves for this piece:

1. A selector, select leaves to be replaced with articulating tuplets, leaves to be transposed
2. A harmonic generator, use the space between True's as intervals to transpose
3. A rhythmic generator (maybe this is best for the second section), use the space between True's as rhythmic intervals
